                <h3>United States History Period 1</h3>
                <h4>Tim Morris</h4>
                <p>Mr. Morris is a very happy, go lucky person. He likes to crack jokes with all the students.</p>
               
                <p>What you are about to read is a 3 paragraph essay. Which is about how technology have effected our generation in todayu's life.</p>
                <h4>Technology and Everyday Life</h4>
                <p>Today technology has greatly bettered our lives. Indiviuals are more connected to the informatiion and people they want to connect with, and the results are smarter, happier and more fulfilled human being. People use technology to locate old and new family or friends. You can also find out what’s going on in the world and in your very own home. In my opinion, technology has bettered this world as a whole, but in the same way it has made the world just a tab worse.
<br>Technology has made long time friends become short time friends. But technology today has gotten so many people in trouble. The way they abuse it, for example people use technology to lurk, spy, and snitch on people. Technology should only be used to connect with lost friends and family.</br>
<br>Just maybe even get close to co-workers and/or classmates. I agree technology is very expensive. But some people walk around in two-hundred or three-hundred dollar clothes on but can’t afford a phone. You have young and old people buying one pair pants that cost two-hundred or three-hundred dollars, for that price you could buy up to date technology to better yourself. Your appearance don’t mean anything if you don’t have knowledge.</br>
<br>In summary, I believe that you should be able to afford two or three hundred dollars clothes. For that two hundred or three hundred dollar clothes you could buy twenty different pair of pants instead of one or two. </br>
