      <p class="statement"> We made World of Emotions photo installation project to display how teenagers in our generation feel and what goes through their mind. The overall vision of our work is to document different emotions of daily teenagers life. The experience we want the audience to have is to wonder how each person feels in their photos. We used photos because it captures the  exact moment in the emotions.  For this project we mixed both black and white photos with color photos based on what we thought would look better. We made a question mark to make the audience question the emotions.
